		<div>The Second Fall</div>
		<div>NEXT</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>In the second garden of Eden the serpent complicated man's decision by offering him a choice between the apple or the word symbolizing the apple. Man chose the word rather then the apple and the information age was born.     Prior to his second fall from grace the rule, actions speak louder then words, had defined for man the proper relationship between actions and words. Words were the servants of actions. When Man chose the word rather then the apple the rule was reversed and from that point on words spoke louder then actions. The resulting fall from grace although gradual progressed to its inevitable end, isolating Man in a virtual world of symbols split forever from the real world of acts. This is the story of that fall.     When first offered the choice between the real apple and the word Man reached for the real apple rather then the word but the snake intervened.</div>
		<div>Back</div>
		<div>Listen</div>
		<div>"Wait," said the snake, "look at the blemishes on that apple. See how misshapen and discolored it is."  The Man hesitated.
</div>
		<div>"Let me show you how you can use words to change that apple," said the snake. His forked tongue flicked back and forth and words appeared, creating a perfectly shaped, beautifully colored, blemish free apple which replaced the real apple.</div>
		<div>The Man was impressed, "Can I use words to do that?" he asked.
"With practice and time you will be able to use words to do much more," replied the snake.  Man didn't hesitate and chose the word over the apple.</div>
		<div>At first Man used words to make small changes in the things around him. He would make sunsets pinker, the grass greener, tomatoes juicer. He became quite skilled in removing the imperfections of the real world and changing it from what it was into what he wanted it to be.</div>
		<div>Then one day a thought occurred to him, "If I can use words to change apples, why not use words to change myself?" He looked into the mirror and his rather plain slightly misshapen face stared back at him. "I'm not plain," he said. "I'm handsome," and the words changed his real slightly misshapen face into a virtually handsome one.   Man's ego freed from the constraints of reality by words knew no limits. He used words to change his real failures into virtual successes, his real weakness into strengths. He used his words to change his bad acts into good acts, his small accomplishments into great ones. With his words he changed himself into a character of perfection of his former self. Using words he freed himself from the limits of his own reality. The snake watched Man's progress with satisfaction.</div>
		<div>"My, My," said the snake to the Man, "you really have used words to make yourself into a very splendid fellow, but of course its all in your imagination."
"What do you mean?" asked the Man</div>
		<div>"Your words can only change you if your imagination lets them. The words can't directly effect what your eyes see, your ears hear, your nose smells or your body feels. The words only change what you imagine you see, hear, smell or feel."   Disappointment overcame the Man.</div>
		<div>"Don't despair," said the snake. "I have a magic box which will turn your words directly into visions, smells, sounds and feelings. You will never have to use imagination again. You can use this box to drive the fastest cars, soar on the strongest winds, travel to the most exciting places and experience the greatest adventures. Anything you can describe with your words will be turned directly into virtual reality.     "Will you give me this magic box?" asked the man.     "Yes," said the snake, "but once I have given it to you, you can never give it back. Do you want it?"</div>
		<div>It did not take the man long to become skillful in using the magic box to convert his words into virtual reality. The worlds he created with his words and his magic box far surpassed the real world in which he had once lived, </div>
		<div>and before long he left the real world never to return again.</div>
		<div>The snake was happy. He had finally rid himself of that pesky man, who was forever wandering into his garden of reality and eating his apples.                                                                   The End</div>
